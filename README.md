# Purpose

I have created this guide as a reference for on how to interact with LLM APIs from the IBM i. I have done this as a reference for my team, but also others who might need assistance. The goal is to increase the usage of AI / LLMs on the IBM i, but in a purposeful and impactful way. There are plenty of services that offer an easy shortcut to running AI, but they can cost a lot of money and not provide any actionable benefit. Hopefully you learn from this guide what makes sense for you and your business to make real impact at your company. 

# Synopsis

The [IBM i OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_i) on [IBM Power Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Power_Systems) hardware is often called antiquated because of its support and ability to run programs compiled from 40+ years ago. This is misnomer. Instead the IBM i allows you to not have to continuously solve the same problem over and over, and instead leverage the solutions of the past (RPG programs that work exactly as expected) with technology of today. How IBM i allows you to do this is with modern interfaces bridging the gap to the rock solid database and programs. 

When writing new modern RPG programs the ability to integrate with AI / a LLM can seem daunting. However once you see how to setup local machine learning or an LLM OR setup an account with an AI company and call their APIs you will realize it is just another tool to help you accomplish the job. At this end of this guide you shoudl have enough information to integrate AI.
